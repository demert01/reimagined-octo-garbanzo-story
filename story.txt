There was once a young man named John. He lived on a small farm with his mother. His entire life had been centered around that farm. The animals, the crop, the barn house, that was all that John knew.

The saying often goes, "When the rooster crows" however, for John it was well before. Up before sunrise in bed far into the night. These late nights in this small remote town often experineced odd activity. John kept a log of this activity. One morning he heard a knock on his door. There were four black SUVs blocking his driveway.
